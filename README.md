## About

There are two pieces of code here. The code in *c_ijm_through_F_public.ipynb* 
calculates analytical expressions for elastic constants of Si and Ge and saves them to 'single_expressions' folder.

*mode_calculation.ipynb* takes these expressions and calculates nonlinear frequency shift for 
Lame and Extension mode for a square plate and a thin beam respectively.

The code is written in Python 2.7 and packaged in Jupyter Notebook files. You need Jupyter Notebook installed
to open them. You can view the notebooks converted to HTML in the 'html' folder.



The software is publicly available under the MIT open-source license.
